Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wmFrog requires the Xpm library (which should be available on most machines
with XFree86 installed). And it requires that the GNU wget utility be installed
as well. wget is a utility that allows you to grab stuff like html files and
images diretly off the www without using a graphical browser. (Also, you
obviously need to be connected to internet in a way that wget will work.)
You also need to have Perl installed.

On FreeBSD systems you may need to use gmake instead of make.

To compile it from sources, you will need: make, gcc, libc6, libxpm-dev, libx11-dev, libxext-dev.
ie: apt-get install libxpm-dev, libx11-dev, libxext-dev
To run it you will need: perl, wget, libx11-6, libxext6 and libxpm4.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a copy of wmFrog already running you should sut it down before re-installing.

1) gunzip wmfrog-x.x.x.tar.gz
1) tar -xvf wmfrog-x.x.x.tar
2) cd wmfrog/Src/
3) make clean
4) make 
5) make install  (as root).
6) wmfrog -h & (or 'wmfrog -h' for help)
7) You need to set the location of perl correctly in /usr/lib/wmfrog if your perl
   is not located in /usr/bin/


Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Find your METAR station name here: 
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/tg/siteloc.shtml
For example Reno, NV is KRNO
Also you will want to set your Time offset from UTC(GMT), for example Pacific time is GMT+8, so offset is 8

Start wmfrog, for example
wmfrog -s KRNO -o 8

See wmfrog -h for many more options.
