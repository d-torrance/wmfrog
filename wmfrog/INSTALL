Installation instructions for wmFrog.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wmFrog requires the Xpm library (which should be available on most machines
with XFree86 installed). And it requires that the GNU wget utility be installed
as well. wget is a utility that allows you to grab stuff like html files and
images diretly off the www without using a graphical browser. (Also, you
obviously need to be connected to internet in a way that wget will work.)
You also need to have Perl installed.

On FreeBSD systems you may need to use gmake instead of make.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a copy of wmFrog already running you should sut it down before re-installing.

1) gunzip wmFrog-x.x.x.tar.gz
1) tar -xvf wmFrog-x.x.x.tar
2) cd wmFrog/Src/
3) make clean
4) make 
5) make install  (as root).
6) wmfrog -h & (or 'wmfrog -h' for help)
7) You need to set the location of perl correctly in /usr/lib/wmfrog if your perl
   is located in a place other than /usr/bin/
