wmfrog for Debian
-----------------

wmfrog version 0.3.1 includes the binary file Src/wmfrog in the distribution
tarball, resulting in a source-contains-prebuilt-binary Lintian warning.

To fix this, the source tarball has been repacked to exclude this file, as
indicated by the +ds suffix in the upstream version number.
